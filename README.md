## Simplify :pen:

<p align="center">
     Simplify is a Chrome Extension that summarizes any article you're reading in just one click! 
</p>

We made and deployed the API to summarize the article on Heroku.



## Motivation

>  The advent of the 21st century has ushered in the information era. Our race has evolved to process mountains of information every day. However, the attention spans of future generations are steadily decreasing. To combat this, we have created Simplify, an innovative tool that allows humans to process large amounts of information at lightning speeds.
